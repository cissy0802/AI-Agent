ICON FILES NEEDED
=================

The extension references icon files in the icons/ folder. You can either:

1. Create your own icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 PNG files)
2. Use the default Chrome extension icon (the extension will still work)

To create icons:
- Use any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
- Or use online tools like: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Create 3 sizes: 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels
- Save them as icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png in the icons/ folder

The extension will work perfectly fine without custom icons - Chrome will use a default icon.
